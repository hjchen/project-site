<p>My Gap: A library of files that allow me to start new website projects quickly.</p>
<p>Whenever I start a new web project, I have to recreate the folder structure and rewrite the required sass files every time. I want to design a workflow that allows me to re-use the basic components every time I start a new project.</p>
<p>This gap affects the other members of my team as well.</p>
<p>I plan to design and develop a basic framework for my future web projects.</p>
