<p>My Gap: A cheap standing desk solution that also has some cable organisation built-in.</p>
<p>There has been many articles written on the harmful effects of sitting all day. But the standing desk solutions available commercially are pretty expensive.</p>
<p>This gap affects the other members of my team as well.</p>
<p>I plan to try to use cheap yet sturdy materials to make a standing desk extension to existing normal desks.</p>
